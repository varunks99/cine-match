# Proposed Workflow: A0

**What are the expectations of each team member towards developing and completing the project?**

**Expectations overall as a team:**

All team members contribute actively to the project by attending meetings, taking up tasks by agreed deadlines, having open lines of communication including mentioning about delays when applicable. Regular reflection of the tasks being undertaken is also expected.

**Individual expectations:**

**Aayush:** I want to create and deploy a ML system which replicates the challenges faced in real world deployment. I expect to contribute in all aspects of the project. I am looking forward to learning about the engineering aspects for such a project. \
**Strengths:** Software engineering skills, data backup and management, experience with Python and ML (a couple of years ago, will need to catch up) \
**Weaknesses**: Machine learning training and deploying \
**Missing gaps in background knowledge:** Learning about ML and kafka along with how to handle big data.

**Rishabh:** I want to learn the design aspects of the ML models and apply the learnings of COMP 551 by deploying the ML models. \
**Strengths:** Software architecture & development in Python and many other languages, experienced with SDLC and automation testing, CI/CD pipelines, SQL, Project management \
**Weaknesses**: Less experienced in implementing ML models \
**Missing gaps in background knowledge:** Effective design of ML systems

**Tamara:** I would like to be able to put together all the skills I have learned in the past (group work, machine learning and software) And have the opportunity to learn new skills through this project. \
**Strengths:** Machine learning and Python (with pytorch), in particular experience with deep learning projects, database (SQL and firebase), Software development, Frontend and Backend development (Web and Mobile), knowledge of many languages (Python, Javascript, Java, Dart, C++, Scala, C, …), experiences with APIs, experience in handling and pre-processing big data, experiences in leading a development team, experience with SCRUM. \
**Weaknesses**: Not very comfortable in English. \
**Missing gaps in background knowledge:** Limited experience with security or some other software concerns. 

**Varun:** I would like to get more experience with the practical applications of ML through this course. I am interested in understanding how to work at the intersection of software engineering and machine learning. I am open to take responsibility in any sphere of the project. \
**Strengths:** Strong background in software engineering and full-stack development (different frameworks in frontend and backend, databases) . Experience in JavaScript and Python. I can actively contribute to developing the backend of the project. I also have experience working with Docker and cloud services. \
**Weakness:** Limited experience with ML implementation. \
**Missing gaps in background knowledge:** Knowledge of only basic ML concepts 

**Yaoqiang**: I am eager to bridge the gap between my academic understanding from COMP 551，COMP 303 and COMP 598, and the real-world applications of machine learning in a production environment. I'm enthusiastic about contributing both from a data science and software engineering perspective. \
**Strengths:** Strong background in software engineering, particularly in big data management and processes. Proficiency in Python，Java and experience gained from courses like COMP551 (Machine Learning) and COMP598 (Data Science). Hands-on experience in the industry, working on large-scale data projects. \
**Weaknesses**: Although I've studied machine learning, I might need some time to get up to speed with practical implementation and deployment of sophisticated ML models. \
**Missing gaps in background knowledge:** Deep understanding of ML deployment in production environments, and working knowledge of tools like Kafka in managing big data flows.

**How often and where will the team meet?**

Frequency of meeting: Once a week

Where will the team meet: In-person meetings may take place on-campus at a convenient location. In case someone prefers to join virtually, we can have meetings over Zoom as well. Meeting links and time will be communicated in the Slack channel.

**What are the responsibilities of each team member during the meetings?**

Active participation in the discussion and sharing of ideas is expected. Each member is supposed to give an overview of what they did in the week, what problems they faced including what the hold up is and mention what they will do the next week.


Members will also perform the following roles: (which will rotate among the whole team)



* Meeting moderator (1) - lead the meeting, lay out the agenda for the meeting, keep everyone on track and keep the meeting time bound. [Note: Everyone can add points but the Meeting moderator is especially responsible for prioritising them.]
* Note takers (1 - 2) - Documents the team minutes.
* Board moderator (1) - Add the issues during the meeting on the board and assign them to the corresponding person.

_Before Meeting: If someone wants to refresh their memory before the meeting they can read the list of tasks from the previous week on their own, or together as well according to individual availability._ 

_Example meeting flow:_



* Each person will talk (2 minutes: round table)
    * Share the progress and what they expect to do before the next meeting.
    * Any difficulties and holdups leading to delays.
* An overview of the current status of the project established.
* Describe next steps.
    * Decide and divide tasks for next week 

Post meeting: 

* Upload meeting minutes on GitLab. One person will upload, others may edit if they choose to do so.

**How will internal deadlines be set, managed, and followed?**



* From the meeting notes, we will identify the issues to be created and work to be done. Then we will use GitLab issues for assigning tasks to the team members and add the deadlines in each issue for completing the deliverable.
* We understand that the deadlines are flexible because issues can sometimes take longer to resolve. We will discuss the progress in our weekly team meetings. 
* In case anyone is facing any roadblocks, we will discuss and try to resolve it. We will also adjust the deadline for the task in case such a situation arises

**How will you coordinate your work?**

Work division has been explained above. For coordinating the code base, we will use gitlab repo. All the artefacts will be uploaded when completed. In progress artefacts will exist on the virtual machines. Since everyone has access to the VM, some team members can pick up where others left off.

**What will be done in case disagreement arises?**

We will discuss amongst the team members and find solutions to obtain the working project. We will refer back to our workflow and resolve them based on what was agreed upon at the start of the term. Further, matters can be escalated to TA or the prof. 

**Modes of communication?**

* Slack is the primary mode of communication. We don’t expect team members to be available by phone for calls but we do expect them to check Slack fairly actively during the week.
* In-person meetings
* Virtual meetings: Zoom
* GitLab issues for dividing work.

**Salient points to be noted:**



* Documentation and reports: A README is expected to be maintained for the project. Creating Wiki pages explaining how certain parts are implemented is encouraged. Architectural diagrams may be added to the repo if time permits before the milestone. Effort should be made to document all code regularly according to best practices. Each team member should take responsibility to document their own code. 
  
* Meeting notes should have: progress, ideas mentioned, next steps to be done, work division, architectural decisions

* Individual contributions: “Link to _significant_ commits by the team member, or external implementation setup on the server”. (referenced from the course repo: COMP585 Fall 2023)
  
* An explanation is expected if there is deviation from the proposed workflow.


### **What do we expect our workflow to look like?**


* We will collate ideas during the meeting over Zoom/ in-person (once a week).
* Work assignment and architectural decisions will be made and meeting notes will serve as the record for the same.
* Gitlab issues will be used to create actionable tasks and to distribute work within the team.
* Each member will work on their issues in their respective branch which will be merged to the development branch. For the final submission, the development branch will be merged into the main branch which will be tagged and submitted.
* Each member will try to reference the relevant GitLab issues in each commit to improve traceability
* Issues will be closed once merge requests are processed.
* Doubts can be resolved in the meeting or people can be contacted over Slack in case quick discussion is necessary.
