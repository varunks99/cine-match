Meeting notes:

All the members met.
TODO: Go over the requirements.
Discussion on milestone 3.


Pick the approach for model:
    We use pre-existing approaches for models.
    One can find the model architecture and others can implement.

Nearest neighbor explanation vs K-NN
Meetings: Tues + Thurs (optional)
Create the dataset for training + testing.
Create the model: training.
Deploying the model.

**Keep good documentation and code practices.**
Pick the architecture and design.
Design - architecture

Issues: (TODO) [this week]
1. Create issues for every person for reading up on the architecture - imp right now
2. Dataset creation: train + test
3. Preprocess the dataset
4. Train the model. (preference for non-gpu based)
    Ensembles may be a good idea.
5. Deploying the whole thing - more details will be needed on this - do background research on what needs to be done. (clarify by the weekend)

Suggestions:
    Create a test for connection - CURL - script
    Deployment script - in the end
