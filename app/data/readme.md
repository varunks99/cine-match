### how can you use the external imdb files?

The movieids from the simulator comprise of the name of the movie and the year separated by '+' symbol. Movie attributes returned by the simulator contain a mixture of data from imdb and tmdb datasets. There are unique ids corresponding to each of these datasets in the response. We want to use the imdb dataset as an external source and found that the name of the movie corresponds to original column of the imdb dataset and the year to endyear column. Through this we can obtain the imdb_id which can be used to join to other tables from imdb to get more information for the movies.
